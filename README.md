# pandas-challenge
# I first created a dataframe where I summarzied the data for the entire school district
# I then created a dataframe summarizing the data for each school in the district
# I was able to determine the best and worst performing schools and was able to find the average math/reading scores per grade per school
# I was able to determine student performance based on 3 different criteria: School spending per student; School size; School Type
# I noted a few observations based on the student performances
